== Description ==
"Hogarth" is a minimalistic and elegant theme named after and developed for the artist Denise Hogarth Nicely. The theme features a fullscreen landing page with a customizable "Cover" block and simplistic layout for posts/pages. 

Note: Continued development of the theme is not planned. However, due to the barebones nature of the theme, most developers can easily modify it. Although not required, use of the "Masonry Blocks" plugin is encouraged (https://github.com/f0xn0v4/Masonry-Blocks)
